			<div class="div_class" width="30%">
				For the HTML side of the webpage, I have used one div, with 3 child divs. The child divs use the "div_class" CSS class.
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="div_class" width="30%">
				For the CSS side of the webpage, I made two classes. The first is named "div_class", which has two variables, "float: left", and "padding-left: 30px". Float will make the child divs "float" left, meaning that the order will be horizontal. Padding-left will mean that the child div is offset by the value of padding-left, which in this case is 30 pixels. The second is named "container", which has the variable "display: center", which centres the text (if it weren't for the fact that's wrong somehow and that I needed to use a manual HTML align for it).
