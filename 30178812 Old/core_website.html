                    Introduction to programming <br>
                    Emerging issues and impact of digital <br>
                    Legislation and regulatory requirements <br>

                <h1>Problem solving:</h1>
                <p>Problem solving in the T-Level Digital Design, Production and Development course is mainly about computational thinking, and how to approach problems.</p>
                <h2>Approaches to solving problems:</h2>
                <p>The three approaches to solving problems are top-down, bottom-up, and modularisation.</p>
                <h3>Top-down approach</h3>
                <p>Top-down approach is where problems are broken into smaller problems.</p>
                <h3>Bottom-up approach</h3>
                <p>Bottom-up approach is where we start with the smallest problem and we combine them with a smaller problem until eventually the whole problem is solved.</p>
                <h3>Modularisation approach</h3>
                <p>The modularisation approach is where problems are broken into components, and then assembled into a solution for the problem.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The four pillars of Computational Thinking:</h2>
                <p>These are the four pillars of Computational Thinking: <br>
                    Decomposition <br>
                    Pattern recognition <br>
                    Abstraction <br>
                    Algorithms <br>
                </p>
                <h3>Decomposition</h3>
                <p>Decomposition is a method to understand a problem easier to solve it. It intends to break the problem up into smaller pieces, so that it is easier to understand.</p>
                <h3>Pattern recognition</h3>
                <p>After decomposition has been used, patterns can be more easily identified within the problems to make solving them easier.</p>
                <h3>Abstraction</h3>
                <p>Abstraction is where unnecessary data is removed to make it easier to understand.</p>
                <h3>Algorithms</h3>
                <p>Algorithms are a method where processes are repeated and expressions are used to help understand the problem easier and solve it.</p>
                <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
                <p>Pseudocode is code used to describe code colloquially and universally. It does not have any rules on what it is, and is generally used to explain code.</p>
                <h2>Program code</h2>
                <p>Program code is code that is written in a programming language. It is generally used to solve a problem or serve some purpose.</p>
                <br>
                <h1>Introduction to Programming:</h1>
                <p>Programming can range from setting a variable to 0, to making an entire application. Therefore, it's good to know how to program.</p>
                <h2>Program data:</h2>
                <h3>Datatypes</h3>
                <p>The common datatypes are:<br>
                    Boolean<br>
                    Character (Often shortened to Char)<br>
                    Integer<br>
                    Float<br>
                    String<br>
                    <br>
                    Datatypes can vary between different languages, mainly due to the nature of the languages themselves and what they are used for. Some may add ones, some may omit ones.
                </p>
                <h3>Declaring variables in Python</h3>
                <p>Declaring variables in Python is pretty simple. Here is an example of how to do so:<br>
                    <br>
                    myVariable = "Hello World!"<br>
                    <br>
                    To explain what we just did, I will break it down.<br>
                    <br>
                    myVariable &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hello World!&quot;<br>
                    VARIABLE OPERATOR DATA<br>
                    <br>
                    To declare a variable, we write the variable name, then the assignment operator, then write the data we want to put into the variable. In Python, the assignment operator is =.
                </p>
                <h2>Operators:</h3>

                </table>
                <h2>File handling:</h2>
                <p>File handling is an important part of Python, as it allows you to access data from files easily, and to use them as saves.</p>
                <p><br>File handling is typically performed in this format:<br>
                    file = open("myfile.txt", "r")
                </p>
                <p>The second parameter in the open function is what is known as the text mode, or how the file is opened. It can be opened in many ways, here is a list of all text modes:</p>
                <table style="width:100%">
                    <tr>
                        <th>Text mode</th>
                        <th>Name</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>"a"</td>
                        <td>Append</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>"x"</td>
                        <td>Create</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>"r"</td>
                        <td>Read</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>"w"</td>
                        <td>Write</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>There is also the option of choosing the file type to open. Python defaults to "t". Here is a list of file operators:</p>
                <table style="width:100%">
                    <tr>
                        <th>File operator</th>
                        <th>Name</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>"t"</td>
                        <td>Text file operator</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>"b"</td>
                        <td>Binary file operator</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <h3>Reading files</h3>
                <p>Files can be read using the .read() method, which reads one line:<br>
                    line = file.read()<br>
                    <br>
                    The whole file can also be read with the .readlines() method, which will read the entire file and output it as a list:<br>
                    file = file.readlines()
                </p>
                <h3>Writing to files</h3>
                <p>Files can be written to using the .write() method, which writes one line:<br>
                    file.write(line)<br>
                    Multiple lines can also be written to the file using the .writelines() method, which will write the items of a list into the file:<br>
                    file.writelines(next_lines_to_write)
                </p>
                <h3>Closing a file</h3>
                <p>Once you are finished with a file, and no longer need to interact with it, you should close the file. While you could leave it as it is, anything that was written to the file will not be saved:<br>
                    file.close()
                </p>
                <h3>Creating a new file</h3>
                <p>Sometimes there isn't any file to begin with, so you'll need to create one. This can be done pretty easily using the "x" file operator:<br>
                    file = open("mynonexistentfile.txt", "x")
                </p>
                <h2>Selection:</h2>
                <p>Selection is used when a decision needs to be made, as it has reached a point where a path diverges. Depending on the decision reached, the process will then continue with one of the paths.</p>
                <h2>Iteration:</h2>
                <p>Iteration is used when a process needs to be repeated for a number of times.</p>
